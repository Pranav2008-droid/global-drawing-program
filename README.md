# A basic project with **google firebase**

---

So this is basically a painting program that allows you to save your paintings in firebase ,retrieve them with the same program and edit them. I made this project with the renderer <u>p5.js</u> and <u>***google*** firebase</u> as a real-time database. 

If  you want to use the program you will first have to create a new realtime database for a project in firebase. after that you have put all your database credentials in the index.html inside the ```firebaseconfig``` variable.
